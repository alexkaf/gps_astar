# GPS Router Finder in Java
## National Technical university of Athens, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
### Project for the Artificial Intelligence course of 7th semester

In this project, a simple GPS was created in order to find the shortest path from a group of taxis to a client. We used the map of Athens and the taxis had locations nearby NTUA while the client was at the ECE School. However, one can insert any map in the nodes.csv file and specify the client's and taxis' locations.

The project was implemented in Java and if one executes the Gps.java file will take a .kml file as a result containing the shortest path between the client and one of the taxis.

In order to find the shortest path, the A-Star <b>(A*)</b> algorithm was used.
